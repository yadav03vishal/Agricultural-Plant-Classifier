# Agricultural Plant Classification Evaluation Test

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to an evaluation test that involves classifying an agricultural plant based on various dimensional and shape factors. The test encompasses data preprocessing, data visualization, testing classification algorithms, evaluating predictions, and comparing the performance of different machine learning models.

## Evaluation Steps
### 1. Data Preprocessing
In this step, the provided dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis. This involved handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables as necessary.

### 2. Data Visualization
Data visualization techniques were employed to gain insights and understand the relationships between different features. Visualization aided in identifying patterns and potential correlations within the dataset.

### 3. Testing Classification Algorithms
Various classification algorithms were applied to the preprocessed data to build predictive models. The algorithms considered may include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and others.

### 4. Evaluating the Prediction
The performance of the classification models was assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.

### 5. Comparing the Methods
Results obtained from different classification algorithms were compared to determine which one performed best for the specific task of agricultural plant classification.
